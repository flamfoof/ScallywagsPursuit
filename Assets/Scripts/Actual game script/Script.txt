HOLY BEACHED MERMAIDS! Lads, get up - we’ve got ourselves an emergency. The captain sent us a message in a bottle!
While we’ve been lounging here like barnacles on your mother’s backside, our captain was nabbed by those cows at the navy.
I for one am not going to let our captain rot in the cage that they put him in - he’s too great a man and we owe him too much. I say we go bust him out.
Now I know some of you may be thinking about how we’ve never sailed the ship without the captain here, 
but I believe we we can figure it out. It can’t be that hard, right? FOR THE CAPTAIN!!!
- Tutorial -
*Movement* - use Left stick to navigate the ship.
Good! We’ve got this tub movin’ lads.
*Firing* - use left and right trigger to fire cannons.
YAARRG! We’ve got ourselves working port and starboard cannons. Remember, we can only reload the guns so fast!
*Dealing damage*
Go ahead and unload on that barrel floating over there, shoot until its a pile of scrap.
*Salvage* - Press B to salvage and repair your ship.
If I remember correctly we can use debris we find in the sea to repair our own ship, lets go salvage what’s left of that barrel we absolutely demolished.

*Looting* - When next to an island, press B to search it.
We are going to need some money/gold/doubloons to buy some booze and food to keep our livelihood up.
Usually we just do small stuff like pillage islands, burn a few towns maybe, and sometimes kidnapping. Come to think of it, the storage room is pretty empty recently…
Go and loot that island near us! Not only will we get richer, our ship will be in better shape too!

Now that we know our way around this ship, it’s time for us to head out to sea and find our beloved captain and show the navy why they shouldn’t meddle in pirate affairs. HAZZAHH!!
